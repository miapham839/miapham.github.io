### üîç Final Project: Predicting Customer Churn with Logistic and LASSO Regression

This project uses machine learning to address a core economic problem: customer retention. I built logistic and LASSO regression models to predict whether a bank customer will churn based on features like balance, age, activity status, and gender. Using 10-fold cross-validation and ROC-AUC for evaluation, I compared model performance and explored how LASSO can select the most economically meaningful predictors. The results provide actionable insights for firms aiming to reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value.
